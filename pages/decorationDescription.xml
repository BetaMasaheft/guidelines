    <head>Decoration Description</head>
    <p>
        <gi>decoDesc</gi> contains a description of
        the various decorative elements found in a manuscript. If
        multiple elements are present you can provide general
        observations in <gi>summary</gi> using it
        directly into <gi>decoDesc</gi>. Within this
        text simply use <gi>ref</gi> to refer to each
        <gi>decoNote</gi> or
        <gi>locus</gi> to refer to a folio. If there is
        a <gi>note</gi> about all miniatures and a <gi>note</gi> about all drawings of a
        certain type, then the sentence in description will point to
        the <gi>decoNote</gi>s involved.</p>

            <summary>
                The manuscript’s decorative features are typical of the period. It includes the Eusebian Apparatus
                (3+7 arrangement) set under colourful stylized arches and followed by a Tempietto. As the pages
                before the beginning of the Gospel of Mark <locus target="#82v"/>, Luke <locus target="#127v"/>,
                and John <locus target="#203v"/> contain inventories and notes it is possible that they were originally
                intended to receive <ref type="authFile" corresp="AT1013EvaPortrait"/>. The miniatures are painted in
                the <term key="FirstSolomonicStyle"/> and recall examples produced between
                <date notBefore="1300" notAfter="1450"/>. The decorations appear to have been paintedby the same artist.

        <hi rendition="simple:italic">can also be used to provide

    <p>Each decorative element in the manuscript is listed in a
        <gi>decoNote</gi> as follows:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <decoNote type="miniature" xml:id="d30">
            <locus target="#108v"/>
            <desc>A miniature of the <ref type="authFile" corresp="AT1008Descent"/> in which <persName ref="PRS5684JesusCh"/>, who is surrounded by a

        </decoNote>
    </egXML>
    <p>Include always a <gi>locus</gi> with <att>target</att> to
        identify the position of the decoration.</p>
    <p>There should be a <ref target="artThemes">ATID</ref> for each
        subject represented as miniature/drawing in the
        manuscript/item when possible (there should also be specific
        ATIDs for subjects that cannot be
        confidently identified (e.g. Saints on Horseback, Holy Men,
        Group of Figures). These latter IDs are to be used only when
        identification is not possible by means of attributes and/or
        captions and/or iconography and/or context. For consistency,
        when editing miniature and drawing
        <att>type</att>s in
        <gi>desc</gi> please try to follow,
        when possible, the following principles.
        <list type="ordered">
        <item>Order: main subject and
        related iconographic elements; main iconographic features from
        left to right and from top to bottom; and secondary elements
        and background.</item>
        <item>Generic References and
        Bibliographic References are given in
        the ATID, include only references to:
        works referring directly to this particular set of miniatures;
        or works relevant to a particular feature of the specific Art
        Theme that are not included in the general
        ATID bibliography.</item>
        <item>Images depicting groups of
        individuals/saints will have a specific
        ATID but, when possible, each
        individual should be identified with the appropriate
        <gi>persName</gi> or
        <gi>personGrp</gi> record.</item>
        <item>Images depicting generical
        geographical features (e.g. trees; mountains) can be encoded
        using keywords (<gi>term</gi>) in the place types section. Towns, areas, etc.
        can use <gi>placeName</gi>. If a geographical
        reference is consistently present in a Art Theme, then consider
        including it in the ATID rather than in
        the <gi>decoNote</gi>.</item>
        <item>Keywords (<gi>term</gi>) are valuable
        tools that you can use to provide further information about
        such features as the style and iconographic elements of a
        theme (<ref target="keywordsIntro">see relevant guidelines page</ref>).</item>
      </list></p>
    <p>Miniatures may include:
<list>
<item>legends that illustrate the
  general subject matter of the miniature;</item>
  <item>shorter captions,
    a short sentence or a word, that identify some of the
    Persons/Objects/Actions in the miniature.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Legends should be
        provided at the end of <gi>desc</gi>
        inside the corresponding
        <gi>decoNote</gi> and use
        <gi>q</gi>. </p>
        <p>Captions should be associated
        to the relevant iconographic element using
        <gi>foreign</gi>:</p>

    <p>Manuscripts that contain exclusively miniatures and no text
