    <head>General Structure of Manuscript Records (Simple and
        Composite)</head>
    <p>It is recommended when starting encoding manuscript records to
        read these guidelines alongside with example records, for example
        of the <ref type="bm" target="/manuscripts/INS0003BAV/list">BAV</ref> or <ref type="bm" target="/manuscripts/INS0312BDL/list">BDL</ref> collections.</p>
    <p>Each manuscript record should contain in
        <gi>msDesc</gi> a description of the
        manuscript's intellectual and physical content, its history and
        the source of the record. The intellectual content of the
        manuscript is encoded in
        <gi>msContents</gi>, divided into as many
        (nested) <gi>msItem</gi>s as needed. The
        physical description of the manuscript is encoded in
        <gi>physDesc</gi>.
        <gi>history</gi> contains all available
        information on the manuscript's provenance and further history.
        The source of the record is encoded in
        <gi>additional</gi>.</p>
    <p>The order for these elements should be for simple manuscripts:
        <list>
            <item><gi>msIdentifier</gi>, see below</item>
            <item> <gi>msContents</gi></item>
            <item><gi>physDesc</gi></item>
            <item><gi>history</gi></item>
            <item> <gi>additional</gi></item>
        </list>
    </p>
    <p>Each codicological unit of a composite manuscript is a
        <gi>msPart</gi>. Since the codicological
        units of a composite manuscript might have different physical
        aspects and origins, all the above mentioned elements can and
        should be used as needed within each separate
        <gi>msPart</gi>. However, the shared aspects
        of the manuscript - for example parts of its history, or the
        description of the binding - can also be encoded for the entire
        manuscript. Therefore, the <gi>msDesc</gi>
        of a composite manuscript might have the following structure:</p>
    <list type="unordered">
        <item>
            <p>
                <gi>msIdentifier</gi>, see below</p>
        </item>
        <item>
            <p>
                <gi>physDesc</gi> Containing the
                physical description pertaining to the entire manuscript</p>
        </item>
        <item>
            <p>
                <gi>history</gi> Containing
                information on the origin and provenance pertaining to the
                entire manuscript</p>
        </item>
        <item>
            <p>
                <gi>additional</gi> Containing the
                source of this record</p>
        </item>
        <item>
            <p>
                <tag>msPart xml:id="p1"</tag>
                Description of the first codicological unit, possibly
                including again <gi>physDesc</gi>,
                <gi>history</gi> and
                <gi>additional</gi> as pertaining only
                to this codicological unit</p>
        </item>
        <item>
            <p>
                <tag>msPart xml:id="p2"</tag>
                Description of the second codicological unit, possibly
                including again <gi>physDesc</gi>,
                <gi>history</gi> and
                <gi>additional</gi> as pertaining only
                to this codicological unit</p>
        </item>
        <item>
            <p>
                <gi>text</gi> Containing any
                transcribed text of any
                <gi>msPart</gi>
            </p>
        </item>
    </list>
    <p>Each <gi>msPart</gi> contains the
        description of its intellectual content in
        <gi>msContents</gi> as well as all the above
        elements, limited now to the description of this particular
        <gi>msPart</gi>. If no further information
        is available for example on the history of a particular
        <gi>msPart</gi> or if no other source than
        the one already specified in the first
        <gi>additional</gi> element concerning the
        entire manuscript has been used, it is not necessary to repeat
        these elements.</p>
