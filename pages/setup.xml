  <head>GITHUB</head>
  <p>Git is a shared repo, public on the web, where we keep our project
  files and code. It contains several repositorires, which are just like
  folders. Here are the files we work on and the documentation, such as
  guidelines and issue tracking. You will use this to:</p>
  <list type="ordered:arabic">
    <item>
      <p>Keep your files in sync with others</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Read the guidelines</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Point out issues, problems requests</p>
    </item>
  </list>
  <p>You will thus want to be always up to date. Here is what to do:</p>
  <list type="unordered">
    <item>
      <p>After you created and verified your account, you will need to
      be added to the group; email Pietro to get this done.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Install <ref target="https://desktop.github.com/">Github
      desktop</ref></p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Prepare in your computer, in a location of your choice, a
      folder called <hi rendition="simple:bold">BetMas</hi></p>

    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the folder BetMas and say ok</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>This will create a folder called schema into your BetMas folder
      which is identical to that in Git and can be synced with it if you
      are online</p>

    <item>
      <p>Repeat the same operation for the repositories called

    <item>
      <p>Click on &quot;Manuscripts&quot;</p>

    <item>
      <p>This will create a folder called schema into your BetMas folder
      which is identical to that in Git and can be synced with it if you
      are online.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>repeat the same operation for all other BetaMasaheft
      repositories you might need</p>
    </item>
  </list>
  <p>The Schema repository contains model files, templates and most
  importantly the schema. These templates will be for you to use daily.
  You will only need to copy the file to your system from the folder.
  Please, leave those files there.</p>
  <p>Let's say you have a new manuscript file to add to the Manuscript
  folder, where these are kept:</p>
  <list type="unordered">
    <item>
      <p>Simply put it in the manuscript folder which you have in
      BetMas.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Open Gihub Desktop and select Manuscript</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click the CHANGE tab and you will see that it has recorded the
      fact that you have added such file to the folder (or modified
      it)</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Below the list of changes there is a Commit field enter a name
      such as &quot;new manuscript ready for review&quot; and a
      description about what you have done e.g. &quot;entered catalogue
      entry 1234 from Catalogue X&quot;</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click commit</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Once it has committed the changes on the top right corner click
      SYNC. This will look for anything that has changed online and
      update your files locally, then will upload your file or update
      the online version from yours.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>N.B. THERE IS NO RISK of data to be overwritten or lost.</p>
    </item>
  </list>
  <p>If you have not updated in the last two or three days, it is
  advisable to Sync all your repo before you begin a work session.</p>
  <p>The SchAth repo contains instead two important parts, beside some
  code used locally for the project. * the Wiki * the Issues</p>


</div>
<div type="level2">
  <head>Issues</head>
  <p>Let's say something goes wrong. e.g. I cannot see anymore the
  values from the schema! or the text displayed is the wrong one!.
  <ref target="https://github.com/BetaMasaheft/Documentation/issues/new">Open an
  issue for that here</ref> and give as much detail as possible.</p>
</div>
<div type="level2">
  <head>Atom</head>
  <p>You can use <ref target="https://atom.io/">Atom</ref> to edit
  files, but to validate and get schema related support (like
  autocompletion) you will need to install a package.</p>
  <p><ref target="https://atom.io/packages/linter-autocomplete-jing">linter-autocomplete-jing</ref></p>
  <p>once you have Atom installed, inside Atom, go to settings (or
  preferences on mac), then click on + install on the left and search
  the above string.</p>
  <p>It will find the package. Click on install and say yes to
  dependencies installation requests.</p>
  <p>You will then see errors messages and will get the autocompletion.
  it works very well!</p>
  <p>You can also pull and push from gihub directly in atom, just click on the arrows pointing up and down in the bottom right corner and you will have really all in one place.</p>
</div>
<div type="level1">
  <head>oXygen</head>
  <p>oXygen is a text editor which is very smart with XML.
  oXygen is designed to help you write XML and it does it in a wonderful
  way, with all possible tools to help you in your workflow. Very often
  you will only use a few of the options provided. Some things you might
  find useful to know:</p>
  <p>You can create a project and add to it your folders, so you can
  open files from oXygen directly.
<list>
  <item>click on PROJECT, then on NEW
  project. call the file BetMas and save it into your BetMas folder,
  where you cloned the repositories from GIT.</item>
  <item>once created the project
  will open in oXygen in a side bar on the left. </item>
  <item>click with the
  secondary button on the icon of the project and select &quot;add
  Folder&quot;</item>
  <item>select the folders in the BetMas folder and add them
  all.</item>
  <item>They will appear under the Project icon. try to open
  manuscripts and click on a file to open it.</item>
  </list>
  </p>
  <p>While editing your file you might start from one of the models.

    <list>
<item>once you start typing a name of an element, oxygen will suggest you
which elements can be used there.</item>
<item>you can also use the elements and
attributes view to select from a sidebar the element to add</item>
<item>once you
have an element and you want to add an attribute, type the space
separating the element name from the future attribute and oXygen will
pull up a list of attributes from which you can select. If an
attribute is compulsary, is bold.</item>
<item>also values for attributes are
suggested by oXygen based on the schema.</item>
<item>to enter a element you can
either start typing it, or you can select a portion of text to tag and
click CTRL+E which will open a small window where you can type the
first letters of an element's name and select. </item>
<item>you might need to
repeatedly enter the same element. you can do the repeat with
CTRL+/</item>
    </list>
    </p>
  <p>You will often have to enter the the current date, for example when
  you describe your work in <gi>change</gi>. To
  facilitate this you can use the Code Templates function in oXygen. Set
  a Code Template for the XML Editor and assign it the current date
  value. Then, while editing to enter today's date open Document/Content
  Completion, start the assistant and enter the date.</p>
  <p>There is a green light on top right corner of your document. If it
  is red, it means something is not valid. click on the small red bar
  along the side of the document to go to that point and read the
  message. Often this is enough, if you don't understand where is the
  problem, ask Pietro.</p>
