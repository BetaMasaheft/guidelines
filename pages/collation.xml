        <p>Each <gi>item</gi> has an attribute <att>xml:id</att> with a value "q" followed by the consecutive number that indicates 
          the physical position of the quire in the manuscript. This allows to refer to each particular quire. 
          The element <gi>dim</gi> with <tag>unit="leaf"</tag> indicates the number of leaves within the quire while the 
          <gi>locus</gi> element contains  information on the quire's boundaries.</p>
        
        <p>Each <gi>item</gi> can also have the attribute <att>n</att> with a consecutive numeral as a value</p>

        <p>The leaves of the quire are counted from left to right, over the centrefold, and referred to with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.</p>
        <!--figure 1  -->
        
        <p>
          The number of leaves in the quire is normally even, but can frequently also be odd (1, 3, 5, etc.).
          In this case, it is necessary to indicate the positions of each single leaf and its stub (the short part of the leaf that "hooks" it into the textblock),
          in relation to the other  leaves of the quire. 
          This can be recorded in the following way:
          <list type="unordered">
            <item>(number of the single leaf), stub before (number of the leaf following the stub)</item>
            <item>(number of the single leaf), stub after (number of the leaf preceding the stub)</item>
          </list>
          
          In some cases (esp. if you work on images), no stub can be detected. This can be recorded as:
          <list type="unordered">
            <item>(number of the single leaf), no stub </item>
          </list>

        <p>An unbalanced quire with an uneven number of leaves in <gi>dim</gi> always needs clarification.

               <p>Here <att>rend</att> is used in the <gi>item</gi> for the quire and
      takes two values (free), "inserted" or
      "with insertion". The value of the
      <gi>locus</gi> in the item, needs to have the
      extremes of the quire, as in
      <tag>locus from="92r" to="99v"/</tag>
      this remains true, and is then clarified in the note as
      necessary. You can use <att>corresp</att> to
      express the linked quire. This assumes that the two quires
      are described separately and that they are put in some
      order. You might also decide to put the inserted quire at
      the end of your list, then using
      <att>corresp</att> is very important.</p>

commented out as no example can be found, but there was an example and an implementation
