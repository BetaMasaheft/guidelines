        <p>Each <gi>item</gi> has an attribute <att>xml:id</att> with a value "q" followed by the consecutive number that indicates 
          the physical position of the quire in the textblock. This allows to refer to each particular quire. 
          The element <gi>dim</gi> with <tag>unit="leaf"</tag> indicates the number of leaves within the quire while the 
          <gi>locus</gi> element contains  information on the quire's boundaries.</p>
        
        <p>Each <gi>item</gi> can also have the attribute <att>n</att> with a consecutive numeral as a value, in which we encode the
            progressive number of quires, assigning "a" as
            value for initial guard leafs and "b" for
            final guard leafs, as in this example from <!--<ref target="" type="bm"></ref>-->

      <div type="level2">
        <head>Encoding the quire structure</head>
        
        <p>The leaves of the quire are counted from left to right, over the centrefold, and referred to with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.</p>
        
        
        <p>
          The number of leaves in the quire can be odd (1, 3, 5, etc.). In this case, it is necessary to indicate the position of each single leaf and its stub, 
          i.e. the short part of the leaf that "hooks" it into the textblock, in relation to the other leaves of the quire (see fig. 2). 
          This can be recorded in the following way:
          <list>
            <item>(number of the single leaf), stub before (number of the leaf following the stub)</item>
            <item>(number of the single leaf), stub after (number of the leaf preceding the stub)</item>
          </list>
          
          In some cases (esp. if you work on images), no stub can be detected. This can be recorded as:
          <list>
            <item>(number of the single leaf), no stub </item>
          </list>
          
        </p>
        
        <p>The quire can include two or more single leaves even if the total number is even:</p>
        
        <p>An unbalanced quire with an uneven number of units for <gi>dim</gi> always needs clarification. 
          You have to indicate which leaf is single using the formulas for the single leaf and its stub as above. 
          No quire structure will be visualized if only the following is given:</p>

          <item xml:id="q2">

        <head>Encoding of further features</head>
        
        <p>Further features of the quire structure can be encoded with the help of the following terms:
         <list>
           <item>replaced</item>
          <item>missing</item> 
          <item>added</item>
         </list>
          These allow you to indicate that the quire was disturbed and one leaf was taken out of it or added into it; 
          you can explain more on the nature or cause of this modification in a <gi>note</gi> (for instance that the leaf was cut, torn off etc.). 
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, to show that the quire of 9 leaves represents originally a 8-leaf quire ("quaternion") augmented with one leaf (8+1=9), 
          you write as follows:
          
          This means exactly that the leaf introduced later is the 2nd leaf of the quire, it's stub is located between leaves 8 and 9. 
        </p>
        
      <p>
        If you have found out that the quire comprising 7 leaves represents the original quire of 8 leaves 
        ("quaternion") where the 4th leaf was lost (8-1=7) you can record this as follows:

        <p>Further explanations might be added in a note elemen before the text,

        <p>The presence, absence and further properties of quire marks (usually Ethiopic numerals assigned by the manuscript-makers to quires, 
          to keep the sequence) such as location, structure, decoration or hand can be described in the

        <head>Visualisation (diagrams and quire formula)</head>
        
        <p>All information encoded in this way will be visualized. Added leaves are shown with hyphens, replaced leaves are 
          dot-hyphen lines (stubs are not shown currently). 
          In addition to that, the same information expressed in the Ethio-SPaRe formula will appear below.</p>
        
        <p>
          "Collation" as described above reflects the formula that has been applied in the project Ethio-SPaRe
          (representing the so-called "English formula", slightly modified and expanded). If you have encoded the information on the
          quire structure correctly,  the numerical "Collation formula" and the structure of each quire ("Quire diagrams") will be visualised.
          The formula is as follows, from the example <ref target="ESum024" type="bm"/>: 
          
          A(4/fols. 1r-4v) – I(8/fols. 5r-12v) – II(8+1/fols. 13r-21v/s.l. 9: fol. 21) – III(6/fols. 22r-27v) – IV(10/s.l. 1: fol. 28; 10: fol. 37/28r-37v) –
          V(6/fols. 38r-43v) – VI(10/ s.l. 1: fol. 44; 10: fol. 53/ fols. 44r-53v) – VII(6/fols. 54r-59v) – VIII(8/fols. 60r-67v) – IX(8/fols. 68r-75v) –
          X(8/fols. 76r-83v) – XI(10/fols. 84r-93v) – XII(8/fols. 94r-101v) – XIII(8+1/ s.l. 9, fol. 110/ fols. 102r-110v) – 
          XIV(6+1/ s.l. 7, fol. 117/ fols. 111r-117v) – XV(8/fols. 118r-125v) – XVI(8-2/fols. 126r-131v) – XVII(8/fols. 132r-139v) – 
          XVIII(8/fols. 140r-147v) – XIX(8/fols. 148r-155v) – XX(8/fols. 156r-163v) – XXI(6/fols. 164r-169v) – XXII(8/fols. 170r-177v).

          Here are explanations to the elements of the quire formula:

         <item>a Roman numeral indicates the physical position of the quire</item>
          <item>the letters "A" and "B" refer to the guard leaf quires at the beginning and the end of the textblock, resp. </item>
          <item>the string in the upper in brackets, in the upper case includes 1) the number of the leaves (from which the type of the quire can be deduced); 
          2) the information on the position of single leaves (s.l.) and their stubs;
          3) the extension of the quire.</item>
          <item>formulas with + or - indicate that the original quire was extended or that some leaves were taken out (5+1, or 7+1, or 9-1, etc.).</item>
          <item>indications to quire signatures precede the Roman numerals (in case the quire mark is written on the first leaf of the quire) or follow it
          (in case the quire mark is written on the last leaf of the quire). </item>

        <head>General or fragmentary information on the quire structure</head>
      
      <p>
        Many catalogues do not provide any information on the quire structure. Sometimes it is only possible to provide
        general information or fragmentary observations on the quire structure. Sometimes the information is imprecise and can be 
        ascertained only by means of a direct check of the physical manuscript. In any case, all available data of whatever kind can be
        summarized in a  <gi>note</gi> inside
        <gi>collation</gi>, as in this example from <ref type="bm" target="BDLaethf7">BDLaethf7</ref>:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <collation>

               <!--<p>When a quire and not just a leaf is added into another
      quire at some point, you can follow this example</p>

<item xml:id="q11" rend="withInsertion" corresp="#q12">

<locus from="92r" to="99v"/>

</item>
</egXML>
               <p>Here <att>rend</att> is used in the <gi>item</gi> for the quire and
      takes two values (free), "inserted" or
      "with insertion". The value of the
      <gi>locus</gi> in the item, needs to have the
      extremes of the quire, as in
      <tag>locus from="92r" to="99v"/</tag>
      this remains true, and is then clarified in the note as
      necessary. You can use <att>corresp</att> to
      express the linked quire. This assumes that the two quires
      are described separately and that they are put in some
      order. You might also decide to put the inserted quire at
      the end of your list, then using
      <att>corresp</att> is very important.</p>
