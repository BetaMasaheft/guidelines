               <p>you need at least the following:</p>

               <p>This information will be analyzed to produce diagrams
      of each quire and formula notations. Added leaves are shown
      with hyphens, stubs are not shown, replaced leaves are
      dot-hyphen lines.</p>
      <p>If you also want to add a note element, please do so before you add text as in this example from <ref target="EMIP00006" type="bm">the Herron Codex</ref>.</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <item xml:id="q22" n="22">
                                      <dim unit="leaf">3</dim>
                                      <locus from="175" to="177"/>

      </egXML>
               <p>Sometimes you might need to describe the position of a
      quire using <gi>locus</gi> elements. Please,
      do this in a <gi>note</gi>, as the <gi>locus</gi> element is here reserved for
      the quire extent.</p>
               <!--<p>When a quire and not just a leaf is added into another
      quire at some point, you can follow this example</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<item xml:id="q11" rend="withInsertion" corresp="#q12">
<dim unit="leaf">4</dim>
<locus from="92r" to="99v"/>
 X (<note>between <locus target="#94">94v</locus>
 and <locus target="#99"> 99r</locus>: <ref target="#q12">the
second codicological unit</ref></note>)
</item>
<item xml:id="q12" rend="inserted"  corresp="#q11">
<dim unit="leaf">4</dim>
<locus from="95" to="98"/>
XI (s.l.: 2, stub after 4; 1, stub after 4)
</item>
</egXML>
               <p>Here <att>rend</att> is used in the <gi>item</gi> for the quire and
      takes two values (free), "inserted" or
      "with insertion". The value of the
      <gi>locus</gi> in the item, needs to have the
      extremes of the quire, as in
      <tag>locus from="92r" to="99v"/</tag>
      this remains true, and is then clarified in the note as
      necessary. You can use <att>corresp</att> to
      express the linked quire. This assumes that the two quires
      are described separately and that they are put in some
      order. You might also decide to put the inserted quire at
      the end of your list, then using
      <att>corresp</att> is very important.</p>

commented out as no example can be found, but there was an example and an implementation
    -->
               <p>Different numerations of quires are encoded as
      follows:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<item xml:id="q26" n="25"> <num value="20">፳</num> <dim unit="leaf">8</dim> <locus from="195r" to="202v"/> </item>
</egXML>
               <list type="unordered">
                  <item>
                     <p>In <gi>item</gi> with <att>n</att> we encode the
          progressive number of quires, assigning "a" as
          value for initial guard leafs and "b" for
          final guard leafs. This information was given in Roman
          Numerals in DomLib, but needs to be in arabic numerals
          here.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p>The numeration given by the scribe is copied and
          annotated with a simple
                        <gi>num</gi> with <att>value</att> element.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p>The number of leafs in the quire is given in
          <gi>dim</gi>
                     </p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p>
                        <gi>locus</gi> provides as usual the
          extremes.</p>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Inside <gi>collation</gi> you can use
      <gi>signatures</gi> for quire marks and
      decoration of quiremarks.</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<collation>
<signatures> Decorated <note>Simply decorated quire marks are
          written in the middle of the upper margin of fols. 3r, <locus target="#11r"/>, 19r, 27r.</note>
</signatures>
<list>
...
</list>
</collation>
</egXML>
<p>Sometimes the information provided in the source cannot be checked and is imprecise. There are cases then
when we cannot give the dimension of a quire, although the schema requires it.
This is a good place for a comment, because this is something which simply needs to be fixed in the description looking at the manuscript.
See <ref target="BAVet43" type="bm">Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Aeth. 43</ref> where the quires missing the information have been commented out.</p>
