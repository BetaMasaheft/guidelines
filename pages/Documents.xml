<p>Texts which are not literary <ref target="definitionWorks">works</ref>
occur often in manuscripts as <ref target="additionsVaria">additions</ref>.
That is way the list of types for this texts is in the
<ref target="http://betamasaheft.eu/authority-files/list">Taxonomy</ref> under 'Additions'.</p>
<p>Please, make sure you encode correctly these texts according to their actual
  status in the manuscript.</p>
<p>If you want to provide an ID for a given text of this type, you can do
  so and create a Work record for it, where the same keywords used in <tag>desc type</tag>
  are added as keywords to the record.
</p>
<p>You need not by any means to always assign an ID to each of these texts, they
  already have one within the manuscript they belong to, which is unique and
  precise enough and you can reference anywhere.</p>
<p>You might find more appropriate to associate a document to
  a <ref target="narratives">narrative unit</ref>,
if the formalization is such, using a <att>corresp</att> in the
addition <gi>item</gi> or in the <gi>div</gi>.</p>
<p>For meaningful groups of documents you can also use the document <ref target="corpora">corpus</ref> grouping</p>
<p>In case your text is in an <gi>additions</gi> <gi>item</gi> and it is composed of different sections,
you can use <gi>seg</gi> with <att>ana</att> as specified in the above page.</p>
