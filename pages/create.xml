            <p>Project members and associates can all contribute to the database by creating <ref
                  target="newEntry">new records</ref> in one of the main repositories (<ref
                  target="manuscripts">Manuscripts</ref>, <ref target="persons">Persons</ref>, <ref
                  target="places">Places</ref>, <ref target="institution">Repositories</ref>, <ref
                  target="works">Works</ref>, <ref target="works">Studies</ref>, <ref
                  target="narrativeUnits">Narrative Units</ref>, <ref target="authority-files"
                  >Authority Files</ref>, <ref target="artThemes">Art Themes</ref>). Please study
               these Guidelines first for definitions.</p>
            <p>In order to be able to contribute you must be assigned editor's rights - if you are
               not sure whether you have them please contact the <ref
                  target="https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/team/projectteam.html">project
                  team</ref>.</p>
            <p>Make sure you have everything prepared as described in the <ref target="setup"
               >Setup</ref> section. Make sure you understand how the GitHub <ref target="workflow">workflow</ref> and
               branches and pull requests work and how the <ref target="entities-id-structure">filenames</ref> are structured. </p>
            <p>Before creating any record, use a thorough search of the application to make sure it
               is not present already, possibly under a slightly different name or spelling; if you
               are not certain, feel free to open a <ref
                  target="https://github.com/BetaMasaheft/Documentation/issues">ticket</ref> and ask
               for advice. <hi rendition="simple:bold">You must always create an issue before
                  creating a new <ref target="works">Work</ref> record to ensure a consistent Clavis
                  Aethiopica structure.</hi></p>
            <p>In order to ensure that Clavis Aethiopica numbers are unique, <ref target="works"
                  >Work</ref> records must be created inside the web application at <ref
                  target="http://betamasaheft.eu">betamasaheft.eu</ref>. Please log in to the
               application by providing Username and Password (only possible from the homepage),
               select the record type from the drop-down menu and click "new".</p>
            <p>In order to ensure unique <ref target="entities-id-structure">filenames</ref> it is also recommended to use the same system for
               all other record types - except for <ref target="manuscripts">Manuscripts</ref>,
               which can be directly created in the relevant collection folders bypassing the
               application.</p>
            <p>Please follow the instructions given <ref target="newEntry">here</ref> and on the
               application. After downloading and before committing the new file, always open it in
               your editor to make sure that it is valid and, if necessary (which it nearly always
               is!), edit it.</p>
            <p>Remember: all files created through the application must be first downloaded to the
                  <hi rendition="simple:bold">/new</hi> subfolder in your local repository, edited,
               and syncronized to GitHub and application through a successful pull request before
               that can be renamed, deleted, or moved.</p>

            <head>Example workflow</head>
            <p>It is not rare that a single unit of work will involve several commits to several
               branches of different repositories. Here is an example:</p>
            <list rend="ordered">
               <item>The contributor starts to edit a manuscript record,</item>
               <item>she thinks an identifier for a new Work is needed,</item>
               <item> she opens an issue, labeled 'Text Identification', pings relevant people and
                  makes sure that this textual unit should be created as a new Work file or
                  Narrative unit file (this also helps contributors who do not have enough
                  permissions to create Works or Narrative units in the app). In the while, there is
                  no need to add a <att>ref</att> to <gi>title</gi> in <gi>msItem</gi> in the
                  manuscript record, for example, a comment can be left that there is a pending
                  issue about the identification of this text part.</item>
               <item> If the result of the discussion is positive and a new record is needed, the
                  editor or some other collaborator creates it in the app.</item>
               <item> Because the Work record or the Narrative unit record has been created in the
                  app, it needs to be synced. Make a Pull Request to Works repository and make sure
                  it is promptly reviewed, corrected and merged. Planning this in the issue where
                  you discussed the creation is a good idea. Please note that it needs to be merged
                  quickly, to keep the app in sync. </item>
               <item>Anyone can now use the newly created Work ID or Narrative unit ID in manuscript
                  records. </item>
               <item>Once the contributor is ready, a Pull Request for the manuscript can be done to
                  the Manuscripts repository. </item>
               <item>During review it turns out it was not necessary to create a Work ID, alas. A
                  collaborator reviewing this Pull Request did not see the discussion and could not
                  intervene before. </item>
               <item>The editor or any other collaborator can now delete the record in the Works
                  repository and make a Pull Request justified by the review of the manuscript, and
                  eventually needs no review if linked to that. By doing this, the app, where the
                  record was created, gets to know and stays in sync. </item>
            </list>
            <p>A record creation in the app should always be promptly followed by a commit and a
               Pull Request to align to the database in any case. If the discussion about this
               operation has already happened, review only needs to focus on typos and contents of
               the record. The app will have learned about the new files because they were created
               in there in the first place. But if you do not merge them into master, as a result of
               a Pull Request and delete them, the app will never get to know that the record was
               deleted (because you deleted it somewhere else). That is why we need a commit and a
               Pull Request, so that repository and database stay in sync.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="level1">
            <head>Doublets</head>
            <p>Doublets may be identified. This happens especially when Works are created without
               enough disambiguation information or when one same manuscript is entered in the
               system from different sources without prior knowledge and due diligence to identify
               the already existing record. It is, however, normal and will always happen.</p>
            <p>If you identify a doublet, it is wise to deal with it in some way or another and it
               is often advisable to consult with other editors and collaborators about this,
               because there may be reasons to have those different records.</p>
            <p> If it is clear that a record is superfluous, delete it, properly document this in
               the commit, make sure the deleted identifier is not used elsewhere, update existing
               references, but also add a relation in the record which survives, like the following.
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <relation name="betmas:formerlyAlsoListedAs" active="IDofthesurvivedrecord"
                     passive="IDofthedeletedrecord"/>
               </egXML> If you delete more than one, the same can be said for each. If the deleted
               ID is requested a redirect will fetch the surviving record. </p>
            <p>It may be also that in cases of doubt or for other reasons that the editors and
               collaborators will discuss you want to keep the double record. In this case, you can
               always use a <gi>relation</gi> with <att>name</att>
               <code>skos:exactMatch</code>, <code>skos:broadMatch</code> or
                  <code>skos:closeMatch</code>. It will be even more useful than usual to give a
                  <gi>desc</gi> in your <gi>relation</gi>. No redirect will be produced, in this
               case, when one of the two is requested, the relations will be visualized, and in case
               of <code>skos:exactMatch</code> this will be with the header.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="level1">
            <head>Delete</head>
            <p>If you make a mistake or find a doublet which needs to be cleaned up or need to <ref
                  target="definitionWorks">reorganize Works</ref> by making one formerly independent
               part of another, you will delete a record. Doing so as you do normally, with a commit
               to the public repositories in GitHub, will add a value to a list of deleted records
               and if a <gi>relation</gi> with <att>name</att>
               <code>betmas:formerlyAlsoListedAs</code> is present in another record of which the
               deleted one was a double, then requesting the deleted item will redirect to that
               record. </p>
            <p>Remember that you can only delete records after they have been syncronized to the
               GitHub cloud and the web application, so if you discovered that you have just created
               a record by mistake before the very first pull request, you must first still download
               it, create a pull request, wait for the merge approval. Only then can a record be
               deleted.</p>
