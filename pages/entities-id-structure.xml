         <p>To create a minimal manuscript record for referencing
    <ref target="minimss">follow these simple guidance</ref>. For
    Places, Institutions, Works and People, look at the dedicated page
    in the side bar. *** ## Manuscript Structure</p>
         <p>Reading of
    <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/de/html/MS.html#mspt">TEI
    guidelines</ref> is highly recommended. It also says &gt; Since each
    component of such a composite manuscript will in all likelihood have
    its own content, physical description, history, and so on, the
    structure of msPart is in the main identical to that of msDesc,
    allowing one to retain the top level of identity (msIdentifier), but
    to branch out thereafter into as many parts, or even subparts, as
    necessary.</p>
         <p>This means that for manuscripts made of only one part we will use
    only <gi>msDesc</gi>, but in any case where a
    structure in codicological units occurs we will use
    <gi>msPart</gi>. msPart can contain other msPart.
    msFrag can be used when there are at least two parts of one
    manuscript kept in different repositories.</p>
         <p>As for
    <ref target="https://github.com/SChAth/ScAthiop/issues/368">issue
    368</ref> we have decided to use msFrag and msPart as follows in
    cases where leaves or quires have been moved. The Ms containing
    currently the unit, will have a msPart with it, with an appropriate
    description and pointer to the manuscript where the unit comes from.
    The Ms which has lost a unit will instead have a msFrag pointing to
    the Ms where the unit is now. Please, do not confuse this with cases
    where leaves or quires are lost.</p>
         <div type="level3">
            <head>General Structure of Manuscript Records (Simple and
      Composite)</head>
            <p>It is recommended when starting encoding manuscript records to
      read these guidelines alongside with example records, for example
      of the BAV or BDL collections.</p>
            <p>Each manuscript record should contain in
      <gi>msDesc</gi> a description of the
      manuscript's intellectual and physical content, its history and
      the source of the record. The intellectual content of the
      manuscript is encoded in
      <gi>msContents</gi>, divided into as many
      (nested) <gi>msItem</gi>s as needed. The
      physical description of the manuscript is encoded in
      <gi>physDesc</gi>.
      <gi>history</gi> contains all available
      information on the manuscript's provenance and further history.
      The source of the record is encoded in
      <gi>additional</gi>.</p>
            <p>The order for these elements should be for simple manuscripts:
      - <gi>msIdentifier</gi>, see below -
      <gi>msContents</gi> -
      <gi>physDesc</gi> -
      <gi>history</gi> -
      <gi>additional</gi>
            </p>
            <p>Each codicological unit of a composite manuscript is a
      <gi>msPart</gi>. Since the codicological
      units of a composite manuscript might have different physical
      aspects and origins, all the above mentioned elements can and
      should be used as needed within each separate
      <gi>msPart</gi>. However, the shared aspects
      of the manuscript - for example parts of its history, or the
      description of the binding - can also be encoded for the entire
      manuscript. Therefore, the <gi>msDesc</gi>
      of a composite manuscript might have the following structure:</p>
            <list type="unordered">
               <item>
                  <p>

                  <p>

      the one already specified in the first

                     <p>Sometimes you might need to describe the position of a

                     <p>When a Quire and not just a leaf is added into another

                     <p>Here @rend is used in <gi>quire</gi>s and
            takes two values (free), "inserted in" or
            "with insertion". The value of the
            <gi>locus</gi> in the item, needs to have the
            extremes of the quire, as in
            <tag>locus from="92r" to="99v"/</tag>
            this remains true, and is then clarified in the note as
            necessary. You can use <att>corresp</att> to
            express the linked quire. This assumes that the two quires
            are described separately and that they are put in some
            order. You might also decide to put the inserted quire at
            the end of your list, then using
            <att>corresp</att> is very important.</p>

            The manuscript’s decorative features are typical of the period. It includes the Eusebian Apparatus 
            (3+7 arrangement) set under colourful stylized arches and followed by a Tempietto. As the pages 
            before the beginning of the Gospel of Mark <locus target="#82v"/>, Luke <locus target="#127v"/>, 
            and John <locus target="#203v"/> contain inventories and notes it is possible that they were originally 
            intended to receive <ref type="authFile" corresp="AT1013EvaPortrait"/>. The miniatures are painted in 
            the <term key="FirstSolomonicStyle"/> and recall examples produced between  
            <date notBefore="1300" notAfter="1450"/>. The decorations appear to have been paintedby the same artist.

          when possible, the following principles.
          <hi rendition="simple:bold">1.</hi> Order: main subject and
          related iconographic elements; main iconographic features from
          left to right and from top to bottom; and secondary elements

          <gi>References</gi> and

          the <gi>ATID</gi>, include only references to:
          works referring directly to this particular set of miniatures;
          or works relevant to a particular feature of the specific Art
          Theme that are not included in the general
          <gi>ATID</gi> bibliography.
          <hi rendition="simple:bold">3.</hi> Images depicting groups of
          individuals/saints will have a specific
          <gi>ATID</gi> but, when possible, each
          individual should be identified with the appropriate
          <gi>PersName</gi> or
          <gi>persongrp</gi> record.
          <hi rendition="simple:bold">4.</hi> Images depicting generical
          geographical features (e.g. trees; mountains) can be encoded
          using keywords in the Place types section. Towns, areas, etc.
          can use <gi>PlaceName</gi>. If a geographical
          reference is consistently present in a Theme, then consider
          including it in the <gi>ATID</gi> rather than in
          the <gi>DecoNote</gi>.
          <hi rendition="simple:bold">5.</hi> Keywords are valuable
          tools that you can use to provide further information about

          section</hi>).</p>
                  <p>Miniatures may include: a) legends that illustrate the
          general subject matter of the miniature; b) shorter captions,
          a short sentence or a word, that identify some of the
          Persons/Objects/Actions in the miniature. Legends should be

                  <p>The distinction between additions (or better

          <hi rendition="simple:italic">Varia</hi> comes from the
          Ethio-SPaRe guidelines. _Additiones _are very often written in
          a secondary hand, and they are later than the main text(s) of
          the Ms. They mark the so-called "secondary life" of
          the manuscript as the latter is used as a repository of
          documentary information, i.e. a true archive.
          <hi rendition="simple:italic">Additiones </hi> that can be

          a recent/old hand, by the same hand as that of the main text,
          by the same hand as that of another addition, etc.); "in a
          secondary hand" should be avoided: it is obvious; - ink (in
          recent ink, hardly legible because of the faded ink, etc.). -
          readability (hardly readable, washed/scratched out etc.); -
          some additiones can be rhymed.</p>
                  <p>Under <hi rendition="simple:italic">Varia</hi>, Ethio-SPaRe
          used to list the following phenomena, which simply concern the

          the work written on the front board or cover, sometimes with
          blue or black paint or ink; - the internal number of the book
          in the monastic library; - the midpoint in the "Psalms of
          David" (in Ps. 77, after the word በደመና፡); - the presence
          of stamps of the owning institution; - part of the line is
          taken up or taken down (e.g., in the Psalters), ff. .... -
          glosses written in the margins of ff. .... - the so-called
          <hi rendition="simple:italic">tämälläs</hi>-sign, in the shape
          of a cross (as +) or two perpendicular lines (as ┴ or├),
          indicating the place where the omissions (written in the upper
          or lower margin) belong: ff. __. - omitted letters, words,
          lines or passages inserted interlineally, in the margins, at
          the beginning/end of the line (ff. ...). - erasures: ff. ....
          - corrections written over erasures, in the main hand or in a
          later recent hand: ff. .... - erasures marked with thin black
          and red lines: ff. .... - corrections immediately indicated by
          the scribe through thin series of dashes above and below the
          letters or the words: ff. .... - spaces for rubricated names
          left unfilled: ff. .... - unfilled spaces marked with thin
          black lines: ff. .... - cues for the rubricator written in the
          margin or in the interocolumn (e.g., small digits): ff. ... -
          erased names or names secondarily written over erased names
          (typically in the supplication formulas): ff. .... - the
          scribe reduced the size of his handwriting to accommodate the
          end of the line: ff. .... - the scribe used compressed script
          ("compressed" means two lines in a space originally
          meant for one single line), often to accommodate lines written
          over erasure: ff. .... - monthly or daily readings are usually
          indicated by writing the names of the months and weekdays in
          the upper margin of the folio, sometimes within frames. - pen
          trials, notes crudely written in pencil or pen; - devotional

          that’s all we have) the range of dates in the Gregorian

                  <p>If the date is documented in the manuscript add
                     <att>evidence</att> ='internal-date'. You can also
          use this attribute in a <gi>date</gi> element ,
          e.g. marking up the colophon text. If the date is known by
          another source, such as the date of the reign of a ruler or
          paleography, please choose the relevant value prompted by the
          schema for @evidence.</p>
                  <p>It is possible to add more than one
          <gi>origDate</gi> if alternative datings
          for the manuscript are provided in the catalogue or
          literature. In these case the source for each date should be
          specified in a <gi>note</gi> inside the
          respective <gi>origDate</gi>. The person
          responsible for the dating can be indicated with @resp inside
          <gi>origDate</gi>:</p>

                  <p>Please, note that almost anywhere text can be annotated,
          for example with a <gi>date</gi> element which
          can take the same attributes as described above. If marking up
          a sentence, for example "in the early 1920s-1930s"
          there is no need to remove the text just mark it up, as there
          is no way to consistently output all options for a date
          value.</p>
