            <head>Definition of works and Assignment of IDs</head>

            <p>We consider a <hi rendition="simple:bold">work</hi> any text with an
independent circulation. This does not mean it has to be alone in a
manuscript. A text which sometimes is added to another is also an
independent work. So <hi rendition="simple:italic">Genesis</hi> is a
work as <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pentateuch</hi> is a work which
contains it. But <hi rendition="simple:italic">Chapter 1 of Genesis</hi>
is not a work, it is a part of the work
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Genesis</hi>.</p>
            <p>Works should not be confused with  <ref target="narrativeUnits">Narrative Units</ref>. To
               decide whether the text you are dealing with is a work or a
               narrative unit, consider  Orlandi 2010, <hi rendition="simple:italic">A
                  Terminology for the identification of Coptic Literary Documents</hi>.
               A work "only refers to fixed contents and a precise
               sequence", see
               <ref target="https://www.zotero.org/groups/ethiostudies/items/itemKey/NWT4X3K9/q/corpus-organizers">Bausi
                  2010, 34 n3</ref>
               </p>

          <p>Works, textparts and Narrative Units:</p>

         <list type="unordered">
            <item>
               <p>Texts provided with an independent circulation get an individual record with a first-level ID (such as LIT1931Mashaf), all
    other are textparts. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Texts which typically form part of other texts are equally assigned an
                  independent firs-level ID/record if they also have an independent circulation. For example, the
                  Anaphoras contained in LIT1960Mashaf (<ref type="BM" target="LIT1960Mashaf">Maṣḥafa qǝddāse</ref>) all have their independent
                  ID and a derived ID in LIT1960Mashaf: the independent abstract work LIT1099Anapho (<ref type="BM" target="LIT1099Anapho">ʾAkkʷateta qʷǝrbān za-qǝddus
                  Hǝryāqos za-hagara Bǝhnǝsā</ref>) is what inside <ref type="BM" target="LIT1960Mashaf">Maṣḥafa qǝddāse</ref> is
                  identified with the <att>xml:id</att> <val>AnaphoraMary</val>.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" corresp="LIT1099Anapho" xml:id="AnaphoraMary">
  <label>Anaphora of Mary</label>
  </div>
</egXML>
The text is then identified as textual unit but also as part of the text where it is contained with reference to that. This corresponds to making a statament as
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <relation active="LIT1960Mashaf" name="saws:contains" passive="LIT1099Anapho"/>
</egXML>
You can then in a manuscript record decide what is more appropriate to point to, if it is better to point to the independent unit directly or if this is in a manuscript as part of another unit.
See for example LIT1960Mashaf#AnaphoraMary in <ref type="BM" target="FSUor15">Frankfurt, Universitätsbibliothek Johann Christian Senckenberg, Frankfurt Ms. or. 15</ref>  and LIT1099Anapho in <ref type="BM" target="BAVet15">Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Aeth. 15</ref>.

            </item>
            <item>
               <p>For these texts (both circulating independently and part of another work), a <gi>div</gi> should also be created, with a
                  <att>corresp</att> giving the individual ID, in order to show the full content of a collection in
                  correct order.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>If a textpart has an individual circulation in other traditions, but not in the Ethiopian tradition,
    all information on this text should be given in the <gi>div</gi>: multiple titles can be
    inserted, with bibliography linking to the IDs of these titles,
    relations for the authors of the titles, etc.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>For text portions (paragraphs, chapters, miracles, etc.) which are extant as different versions in multiple recensions of the same work or even in different works,
                  create a <ref target="narrativeUnits">Narrative Unit</ref>.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>The existing records inherited from the EAe index that do not
    have an independent circulation in Ethiopic should be deleted.</p>
            </item>
         </list>

         <p>See as example
            <ref target="LIT1931Mashaf" type="bm">LIT1931Mashaf</ref>.
         </p>

         <p>Often the first problem to face is which records and how many to
make. We accept as a principle to create <hi rendition="simple:bold">the
maximum number of record as it is sensible</hi> and to state
<hi rendition="simple:bold">the minimum number of relations needed among
them</hi> with a view on expanding them potentially to all what is not
essential, in order to clarify their relation with each other. It might
happen that different researchers have different opinions on the
relation between the versions and the manuscripts and in this we will be
able to host them all.</p>

         <p>For example. If the Work A has four versions 1, 2, 3 and 4, 1 being a
short version of 2 and 3 a later version of 4 while 2 and 4 differ from
one another only in the order in which the content is organized, there
will be 5 records, one for the abstract work, one for each version.
While the abstract work will point to each of the 4 version with
relations and might contain a general description of the work, each of
the version will have clearly defined relations with the others and the
abstract Work.</p>

         <p>A further example: a text which is made of parts which can occur in
different orders within different manuscripts. This will have 1 Work
record, describing the ideal or majoritarian, or standard sequence,
while each witness (Manuscript) will contain the specific order of the
parts in it.</p>

         <p>Create a new record for every different version, recensions, etc. and
then express the diverse relations between the records with relation
elements. This should be clearer and leave space for more differing
opinions than to try to express the relations within one single
record.</p>
