            <head>Getting Started</head>
            <p>Each Art Theme gets a file with an ID assigned (= ATID). Before creating a new
  ATID make sure it does not already exist, if
  you create the file on the app make sure you:
 <list>
   <item>a) add the ID to the taxonomy in the
  Art Themes section;</item>
 <item>b) create a new
  file and save it in new;</item>
  <item>c) commit
  the newly created file.</item></list></p>
            <p>The ID should be concise, and should ideally allow identification
  of Theme/Object:</p>
            <list type="unordered">
               <item>
                  Art Theme ID (ATID) = AT1005Crucifixion (AT + incremental
      number + first word of Art Theme)
               </item>
            </list>
         </div>

         <div type="level1">
            <head>Title</head>
            <p>For the title of the work, when possible:
  <list>
     <item>
        a) include most common definition in
  British English;
     </item>
  <item>
     b) include Ge'ez
  title;
  </item>
  <item>
     c) consider including
  alternative titles used in principal art projects (e.g. ICONCLASS,
  Artstor, Index of Christian Art).
  </item>
  </list>
  Minimally, it has to contain an English title:</p>

         </div>

         <div type="level1">
            <head>Description</head>
            <p>Each ATID should contain a brief description
               outlining its subject-matter and principal recurring features. This saves repeating information in the actual description of the manuscript, where details and variants should be encoded.
               If more
  than one typology is attested for a particular art theme in the
  Ethiopian tradition, provide a brief description of the features of
  each typology.</p>
            <p>In addition to this basic information you may choose to provide
  references to person, places and textual units IDs that inform the content
  of the ATID (e.g The Crucifixion will include a
  reference to the Gospels) and/or, where possible, to the relevant
  passages of that work with <att>cRef</att>:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <abstract>
                     <p> Miniature showing <persName ref="PRS5684JesusCh">Jesus</persName> in the Garden of Gethsemane before his Arrest,
                        (<ref cRef="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0031.tlg001.perseus-grc1:26.36">Mt 26:36</ref>;
                        <ref cRef="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0031.tlg002.perseus-grc1:14.32"> Mk 14:32</ref>;
                        <ref cRef="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0031.tlg003.perseus-grc1:22.39">Lk 22:39</ref>;).
                     </p>
                  </abstract>
               </egXML>
               Finally, the
  description can be expanded to mention whether a theme type is
  attested in other traditions, in which case provide relevant
  bibliographic data.</p>
            <p>The presence and text of captions and legends should be encoded and ideally transcribed in the manuscript description, not in the Art Theme record,
               see <ref target="decorationDescription">decoration description</ref>.</p>
          <!--  <p>Similarly, Work IDs can be used to specify
  the particular scene in a miniature with a generic
  ATID within a
               <gi>decoNote</gi>. <!-\-DR 2019-04-10 Doesn't this belong to <ref target="decorationDescription">decoration description</ref>? Do we have an example?-\-></p>-->
            <p>Ex. 2</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <abstract>
                  <p> A miniature showing the Crucifixion of  <persName ref="PRS5684JesusCh">Jesus</persName>.
                     The scene may include a number of additional figures, such as the  <persName ref="PRS6819Mary">Virgin Mary</persName> or
                     <persName ref="PRS5695John">John</persName>, the scene typically follows the account of the
                     <ref type="work" corresp="LIT1560Gospel">Gospels</ref>, but  may include iconographic elements inspired by
                     apocryphal sources.

                     The three main typologies attested in the Ethiopian tradition are:
                     <list>
                        <item>Type 1 <desc>There is an Empty Cross and there are figures associated with it
                           (i.e. it is not just an interlaced cross).</desc>
                        </item>
                        <item>Type 2 <desc>The body of  Living Jesus is nailed to the cross.</desc>
                        </item>
                        <item>Type 3 <desc>The body of the Dead Jesus is nailed to the cross.</desc>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
               </abstract>
</egXML>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="simple:bold">N.B.</hi> Typologies are encoded using
  keywords, see the
               <ref target="authority-files">authority files</ref> for further details.</p>
            <p>Consider including relevant keywords (e.g. The Theme of the
  Crucifixion should contain keywords such as Bible; Crucifixion;
  Passion of Jesus; New Testament) to link it to other works
  (artistic/literary) and content that is relevant to that
  ATID, these are placed after
  <gi>abstract</gi>.</p>
            <p>Ex. 3</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

  <keywords scheme="#ethioauthlist">
  <term key="Bible"/>
  <term key="NewTestament"/>
  </keywords>
</textClass>
</egXML>
         </div>

         <div type="level1">
            <head>Relations</head>
            <p>As in all other records, a <gi>listRelation</gi> can be added to Art Theme records to to list specific relations between this and other records.
               For the encoding of relations, see <ref target="relations">Relations</ref>. For the relation between an Art Theme and the entities it is depicting, use 
              <tag> relation name="ecrm:P129_is_about"</tag>:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <listRelation>
                  <relation 
                      name="ecrm:P129_is_about" 
                      active="AT1108MMDaqseyos" 
                      passive="LIT3586Miracle"/>
               </listRelation>
               </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>
               Also relations to external authorities, like ICONCLASS 
               are very useful, for disambiguation and enrichment of the data.
               In <ref target="AT1026NativityMary" type="BM">Nativity of Mary</ref> 
               you can see the connections which can be based on a 
               simple relation like the following.
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <relation 
                        name="skos:exactMatch" 
                        active="AT1026NativityMary" 
                        passive="ic:73A31"/>
               </egXML>
              </p>
         </div>

         <div type="level1">
            <head>Bibliography</head>
            <p>Lastly, please include at least a couple of references to the
  relevant bibliography at the end of your file. If there are works that
  deal with the history of the ATID in Ethiopia, these should be always
  included. For some themes, there might not be such a publication, in
  which case strive to include a reference that provides at least some
  basic information and additional references to the topic. Ideally also
  include a reference to one or more works dealing with the broader
  history of the ATID in art. Before adding the
               bibliography, make sure you have carefully read our guidelines
               on the matter
               <ref target="zotero">here</ref> and
  <ref target="bibliographic-references">here</ref>.</p>
