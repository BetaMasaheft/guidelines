                <head>How it works</head>
                <p>These guidelines are fed by a Github webhook pushing into the web application at
                        <ref target="Guidelines" type="bm">http://betamasaheft.eu/Guidelines/</ref>
                    data from the<ref target="https://github.com/BetaMasaheft/guidelines">
                        guidelines repository</ref>, the <ref
                        target="https://github.com/BetaMasaheft/guidelines">Beta maṣāḥǝft schema
                        repository</ref> and the <ref target="https://github.com/BetaMasaheft/RDF"
                        >Beta maṣāḥǝft ontology (this is not via webhook)</ref>.</p>
                <p>If you edit and push (or make a pull request) to the above repos, the XML files will be
                    sent to the application and go live so that you can see them, search, browse,
                    read, etc.</p>
                <p>All edits to the guidelines should be made as a pull request, and not be pushed directly to the main branch. This is to ensure that the guidelines do reflect the 
                entire team's decisions and that everyone is aware of any changes made to them. It is not necessary to assign all team members as reviewers, but do assign those 
                who seem to you the most competent to check the particular edit. The reviewers should then check that the text of the guidelines reflects the decision taken, that the English is correct and
                understandable and that all useful linkage is present.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="level3">
                <head>Editing the XML</head>
                <p>You can use any editor you like to edit the XML files. This page describes only the editing of the guidelines, for the editing of the schema
                    see
                    <ref target="editingSchema">editing the Schema</ref>.</p>
                <p>There is a Beta maṣāḥǝft Guidelines Schema which validates the files you
                    are pushing to the app when editing the guidelines and will notify you if anything goes wrong. Actually,
                    there are processing instructions in every single file that should allow your
                    editor to validate your XML BEFORE you push it to the repo. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="level3">
                <head>Principles</head>
                <p>In principle, given that the information is displayed together, what is already
                    specified in the schema should not need further clarification, so, e.g. there is
                    no need to repeat a list of values for an attribute if this is in the
                    schema.</p>
                <p>Besides the schema folder (which
                    is the Beta maṣāḥǝft Guidelines Schema), the guidelines folder contains subfolders for pages, elements, the table of contents (toc) and the user guide:</p>
                <list>
                    <item>Pages are descriptive pieces like this one, trying to explain how to
                        encode something.</item>
                    <item>Tables of Contents (toc) are simply lists, organizing pages in meaningful
                        ways based on type of user, kind of task, etc.</item>
                    <item>Elements describe one element: They link to the page of the respective element in the TEI guidelines, fetch from the Beta maṣāḥǝft schema any further
                        specification and link back to all guideline pages mentioning this element.</item>
                </list>

            </div>
            <div type="level3">
                <head>Documentation Tags</head>
                <p>We use the <ref
                        target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/de/html/TD.html#TDphrase"
                        >TEI Documentation Elements</ref>.</p>
                <p>The application will use the <att>xml:id</att> in <gi>body</gi> to identify the
                    pages and elements, so, please take care not to duplicate <att>xml:id</att>s if you are
                    creating a new page. The application will use the <gi>title</gi> inside
                        <gi>titleStmt</gi> as a label for that resource. This means that you can
                    have a page and an element called "person" but these will need two different
                        <att>xml:id</att> in <gi>body</gi></p>
                <p>We use <gi>div</gi> elements to structure the contents. These should have <list>
                        <item>A <att>type</att> with <val>level2</val> where the digit is a number
                            from 2 to whatever the deepness of sections required is. </item>
                        <item> A child <gi>head</gi> with the title of the subsection.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>You can use <gi>table</gi> and <gi>list</gi> and their children as specified in
                    TEI.</p>
                <p>Links are encoded using <gi>ref</gi> with <att>target</att>:
                    <list>
                        <item>You can enter in <att>target</att> simply the ID of any of the pages
                            in the guidelines:
                            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                for the editing of the schema see <ref target="editingSchema">editing the Schema</ref>
                            </egXML>
                        </item>
                        <item>You can add a <att>type</att> with <val>bm</val> and your
                                <att>target</att> can simply be the ID of any of the entities in
                            Beta maṣāḥǝft. This is useful to link to examples:
                            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                special cases like <ref target="BNFet45" type="bm">BNFet45</ref>
                            </egXML>
                        </item>
                        <item>If you enter a URL, this will become an external link:
                            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                entering data in the <ref target="https://www.zotero.org/groups/ethiostudies/items">Zotero Group Library.</ref>
                            </egXML>
                        </item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>Please always use <gi>gi</gi>, <gi>tag</gi>, <gi>att</gi> and <gi>val</gi> to
                    mark up respectively element names, tags, attributes names and values. You do
                    not need to type angle brackets and escape them or to add @ in front of every
                    attribute, this will be done during the visualization. For elements a link will
                    also be given to the page for that element.</p>
                <p>To add examples of XML markup, use the <gi>egXML</gi> element, always with its
                    namespace so, <tag>egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"</tag>. This
                    allows the validation to skip the contents (i.e. do not add again the TEI
                    namespace in the examples).</p>
                    <p>Good practice should be always used in providing examples, which should not be made up but reflect the encoding in a currently existing file. It is also good practice to add a <gi>ref</gi> with a link to the file where this is to be found.</p>
                <p>You can use <gi>cit</gi> and <gi>quote</gi> for quotations.</p>
                <p>If you really want to make something bold or italics use <tag>hi
                        rendition="simple:bold"</tag> and <tag>hi
                    rendition="simple:italic"</tag></p>
                <p>In a Table of contents file, please only use <gi>list</gi> and enter as content of the <gi>item</gi>s only the ID of the page you want the ToC to point to.</p>
