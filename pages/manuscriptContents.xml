                    <hi rendition="simple:italic">tämälläs</hi>-sign, in the shape
                    of a cross (as +) or two perpendicular lines (as ┴ or├),

                    later recent hand: ff. .... - erasures marked with thin black
                    and red lines: ff. .... - corrections immediately indicated by

                    ("compressed" means two lines in a space originally
