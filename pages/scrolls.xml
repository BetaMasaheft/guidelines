              <head>Description of Scrolls</head>
                <p>We treat scrolls in the same way as <ref target="manuscripts">codices</ref> and any other written artefacts,
                    and only add in <gi>objectDesc</gi> the value Scroll for <att>form</att>. However,
                    there are several specific features of encoding the descriptions of scrolls.</p>

                    <p> Since the scrolls are sewn together mostly of several parchment strips,
                      there is a possibility of assigning <gi>xml:id</gi>s to single strips and of a consistent
                      encoding of their sizes, as follows:
                      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <dimensions type="outer" unit="mm">
                              <height>1590</height>
                           </dimensions>
                           <dimensions type="outer" unit="mm" xml:id="strip1">
                              <height>486</height>
                              <width>100</width>
                           </dimensions>
                           <dimensions type="outer" unit="mm" xml:id="strip2">
                              <height>588</height>
                              <width>120</width>
                           </dimensions>
                           <dimensions type="outer" unit="mm" xml:id="strip3">
                              <height>540</height>
                              <width>97</width>
                           </dimensions>
             </egXML>
                    </p>
                    <p>The assigned <gi>xml:id</gi>s can be referenced to while encoding
                  other features. For example:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <layout columns="2" writtenLines="68" corresp="#strip1">
                      </layout>
                  </egXML>

                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <head>Encoding of the Text Transcription</head>
               <p>When structuring the text transcription of your scroll
                   for <ref target="references">referencing</ref> you may consider
               to use specific <gi>div</gi>s for recto and verso.</p>
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <div type="edition">
                        <div type="textpart" subtype="recto">
                            ...
                        </div>
                        <div type="textpart" subtype="verso">
                            ...
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </egXML>
                <p>If you have <gi>lb</gi> inside these divisions you will of course be able to use them
                as a referencing structure.</p>
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <ref cRef="MyScroll1.recto.12"/>
                </egXML>
                <p>The same method can be used if desired to encode parchment strips, however it is likely that
                hierarchies problems will arise, it is thus advisable to use
                a simple <tag>milestone unit="parchmentStip"</tag> with <att>n</att>.
                    This will not become a referencing structure in the BM application
                but will allow you to encode in any point of the text where this is
                convenient the occurrence of this change. While a page break occurs only in one point, this
                type of change, as the one of block of stone for a running
                architectural inscription, for example, are likely to occur several times in one transcription.
                You will have where convenient this <gi>milestone</gi> as many times as needed (with the same <att>n</att>).
                </p>
                <p>It is generally enough to encode the text of the inscription in the file,
                    but there are cases in which you might need to separate the content from the
                    support description, in which case, simply use a work record for the content
                    and place there the edition of the text.</p>
