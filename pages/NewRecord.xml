                <head>Create a new record</head>                
                <p>If you have editor rights and are logged in to the application, you can find a new "create new entity" function in the navigation bar of
                    the app. You only need to enter the name of the file, for manuscripts this is
                    the full filename, for the other entities just the last (non-numerical) part of
                    the ID (see <gi>TEI</gi> schema specification). For LIT1234iliad, you would
                    enter only "iliad". The non-numerical part of the ID <hi rendition="simple:bold"
                        >may not exceed 15 digits and may only include ASCII symbols</hi>. For a
                    manuscript, simply enter the full name, the small print will indicate you what
                    is needed. As you start typing the button will become active and you can create
                    the file. This is stored in the app, not in Github! As the confirmation page
                    will tell you blinking, you need to <list rendition="ordered">
                        <item>download the file</item>
                        <item>save it in a folder called "new" into the proper folder</item>
                        <item>commit and sync to git</item>
                    </list> Once you have done this GIT and our server will be again in sync, which
                    means you can now move your file if you need to (especially for manuscripts) and
                    then <hi rendition="simple:bold">commit and sync this change again.</hi></p>
                <p> If you omit the first step, we will have two identical files in two locations
                    and thus the ID lookup of the app will fail not showing you your file. On
                    leaving the page you will get a warning every time, intended to make you stop
                    before you carry on without syncing. The generated file will have a consistent
                    new ID and will insert it in the appropriate place in the file. This should
                    avoid the frequent problem of IDs not being updated after copy-pasting a master
                    file. It remains entirely possible to create your files in Oxygen as previously,
                    but the application interface is recommended as it makes sure your ID is unique.
                    The file will also have the correct type and a <gi>change</gi> element with your
                    initials and current date.</p>
                <p>Especially when creating a new work record, where the numerical part of the ID
                    will become the Clavis reference number, only the app should be used.</p>
                <p>Check the principles for creating a <ref target="works">WORK entity</ref> and the
                    page about how to <ref target="placeOrInstitution">decide between a place and a
                        repository</ref> record. </p>
                <p>To decide whether to create a new place record or not if in doubt, try the
                    following. <list>
                        <item>check if there is a record already in our list</item>
                        <item>if yes, then <list>
                                <item>check if there is also a Wikidata item (you can simply google
                                    what you are looking for, open the correct Wikipedia page you
                                    find and hit the Wikidata item link on the left).</item>
                                <item><list>
                                        <item>if yes add a <att>sameAs</att> attribute with the Q-ID
                                            in the URL or at the top of the item.</item>
                                    </list></item>
                                <item>check if there is also a record in geonames.org</item>
                                <item><list>
                                        <item>if yes add a <att>sameAs</att> attribute to place
                                            linking to such geonames ID.</item>
                                        <item>if not leave the record</item>
                                    </list></item>
                            </list></item>
                        <item>add a ref to our record</item>
                        <item>if not, then</item>
                        <item>check if there is also a Wikidata item</item>
                        <item>check if it is in geonames.org</item>
                        <item>if yes add the URI in the <att>ref</att>
                        </item>
                        <item>if not (but check thoroughly, because it would be an exception) create
                            a new place record</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>Generally, when possible it is always preferable to have an external link to an
                    authority file for places out of scope which we are not going to describe or
                    give details about. If there is already a record, no need to delete it or update
                    it. Simply add the Wikidata Entity.</p>
                <p>Adding references to places not in our database: <list>
                        <item>for ancient place prefer Pleiades, with namespace Pleiades</item>
                        <item>for places related to the Coptic literary tradition use PAThs</item>
                    </list>
                </p>
