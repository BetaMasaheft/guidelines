         <head>Text Encoding</head>
         <p>TEI records are for <hi rendition="simple:bold">Text</hi>
    encoding, and this page deals with any text encoded in any type of record. This page does not constitute a prescriptive list of features to be encoded when
    working with text. It simply lists the possibilities of text encoding employed until now in the project. It is always up to the encoder to decide which of these features
    they want to encode in a particular record.
         </p>
         <p>While text can be contained in all kinds of records, large portions of text will typically be encoded in manuscript and work records. 
            We record in <ref target="manuscripts">manuscript</ref> records the transcription of the
            text of the catalogued manuscript, when available, whilst   <ref target="works">work</ref> records contain the edited
            text or its  theoretical structure. Sometimes however, a text does not clearly fall into one of these two groups and
            it is not immediately clear whether it should be encoded in a manuscript or work record.
            This can then be decided on a  case by case basis by the encoder (an issue can always be opened to discuss the best solution).
            It is always crucial to mention the source of the text
            whenever this might not be completely obvious. Here are some guiding principles for this decision:
         <list>
            <item>The (diplomatic) transcription of a manuscript, which represents the text with all its features as it is in that particular witness, 
               belongs to the manuscript record. One manuscript may contain, from different sources, more than one transcription of the same manuscript.
           </item>
            <item>An edition of a work, i.e. a critical edition, based on one or more manuscripts (transcriptions) belongs to the work record. 
               This is structured as the text requires, in chapters, verses, etc., and may contain an apparatus criticus.</item>
            <item>If there is text available that would belong in a manuscript record, but there is no record planned for this manuscript or its 
            encoding is not planned, this text might also be included in the relevant work record. It is particularly important to mention the source of the text in
            these cases.</item>
            <item>The same is true for text of manuscripts in the process of being catalogued which might not be made available soon. It might then 
            be useful for all to make the transcribed texts such as incipits and explicits available in the work records.</item>
            <item>It is not necessary to copy a manuscript transcription to the work record (unless the transcription is the starting point 
            for a critical edition which will be carried out in the work record) simply to have it in both places. On the web application, manuscript witnesses of works can 
            easily be retrieved.</item>
            <item>In such cases, judgment might be applied in deciding which markup pertaining to the text's features in a manuscript witness
               will be preserved in the work record. </item>
         </list>
         </p>
         
    <p>
    In both manuscript and work records, text is entered in the <gi>body</gi> of a
    TEI file in a <tag>div type="edition"</tag> .
    Each text part should be contained in a
    <gi>div</gi>. <gi>div</gi>s should
    always be well nested one into the other. These will always take a
    <att>type</att> with <val>textpart</val> and a
    <att>subtype</att> with the desired value. There should
    always be also a <att>n</att> identifying, for example, chapter 3 as well as a
    <att>corresp</att> pointing to the appropriate
    <gi>msPart</gi> or <gi>msItem</gi> in the case of manuscript transcriptions.

         <p>
            <gi>locus</gi> should not be used in <tag>div type="edition"</tag>. When transcribing the text of a manuscript in the manuscript record, the elements described below such as <gi>pb</gi> or <gi>cb</gi> should be used
            as far as possible to state the location
            of the text within the manuscript, whether the entire manuscript or parts of it are transcribed. Sometimes, the indications given by catalogues are too vague to allow for such precise encoding. 
            In this case, the location of excerpts should be stated
            in a <gi>note</gi> in the corresponding <gi>msItem</gi>, referring the excerpt with its <att>xml:id</att>, such as in the following example from <ref type="bm" target="BNFet117"/>:

               <p>TEI is made for this and there are many other things
        which can be much better and more precisely encoded.</p>
               <p>When the record does not yet contain any text transcription,
        but information about some of the above-listed phenomena is
        available, this should be stated temporarily in a note with a
        commentary for future changes in the respective <gi>msItem</gi>:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                 <note>This prayer is written in negative writing. </note> <!--Information belongs to text transcription-->
               </egXML>
               <p>Note, however, the different usage for the information about 
                  rubrication, which is entered in <gi>handNote</gi>, see <ref target="handDescription">Hands Description</ref>.</p>
               <p>Partial rubrication, where only parts of an element (typically numerals and punctuation marks) are rubricated can be marked up by 
               pointing to a <gi>rendition</gi> element</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <rendition xml:id="partialRubric">Red ink is used only partially (e.g.!!!)</rendition>
               </egXML>
               <p>This can be referred to with <att>rendition</att> when encoding a part of text like in the following example.</p>
               <egXML  xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <hi rend="rubric" rendition="#partialRubric">፨</hi>
               </egXML>
               <p>If possible, this becomes even more interesting if related also to a specific <gi>handNote</gi>.
                  <egXML  xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <hi rend="rubric" rendition="#partialRubric" hand="#h1">፨</hi>
                  </egXML>

   <p>As there is a <tag>div type='edition'</tag> there can be a <tag>div type='translation'</tag>, a feature inherited 
      from the main structural <gi>div</gi>s of an edition from the <ref target="https://epidoc.stoa.org/gl/latest/supp-translation.html">EpiDoc Guidelines</ref>. 
      You can add this beside your <tag>div type='edition'</tag> in any manuscript or textual unit file where you want to provide a translation. 
      To align parts of the translation to parts of the text, edition or transcription, you can use standard linking practices, that is to say, point to the correct <att>xml:id</att>.</p>
   <p>The following example is taken from <ref type="BM" target="LIT5064HEpA">History of the Episcopate of Alexandria</ref>.</p>
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <div type="edition" xml:lang="gez" xml:id="etiopica">
         <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30" xml:id="chapter30Eth">
            <ab>
               ወእንዘ፡ ያንጐርጐሩ፡ ብዙኃን፡ በእንተ፡
               ...
            </ab>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="translation" xml:lang="en" xml:id="translationEthio" corresp="#etiopica">
         <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30" xml:id="transchapter30Eth">
            <ab>While many murmured for the fact that the appointment
               ...
            </ab>
         </div>
      </div>
   </egXML>
   <p>You can of course also add <att>corresp</att> to the text parts if you so wish.</p>
   <p>As long as you give them an <att>xml:id</att> and possibly link them to the edition on which they are based, 
      you can add as many translations as you want, in the same way in which you can add as many editions or transcriptions as you want.
      Please, see <ref target="referencing-the-text">this referencing page</ref> for how to point to a specific translation.
