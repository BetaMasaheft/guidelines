         <p>Before creating new entities for PLACES like Stuttgart, Paris,
    London, etc. which unlike all institutions are very much unlikely to
    receive specific descriptions by this project, use external links to
    geonames ids as follows.</p>
         <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<country ref="gn:2017370"/> 
<settlement ref="gn:498817"/>
</egXML>
         <p>(same for placeName and region)</p>
         <p>to decide whether to create a new place record or not if in
    doubt, try the following. * check if there is a record already in
    our list * if yes, then 1. check if there is also a wikidata item
    (you can simply google what you are looking for, open the correct
    wikipedia page you find and hit the wikidata item link on the left.
    * if yes add a @sameAs attribute with the Q id in the url or at the
    top of the item. 1. check if there is also a record in geonames.org
    * if yes add a @sameAs attribute to place linking to such geonames
    id. * if not leave the record 1. add a ref to our record * if not,
    then 1. check if there is also a wikidata item 1. check if it is in
    geonames.org * if yes add the uri in the @ref * if not (but check
    thoroughly, because it would be an exception) create a new place
    record</p>
         <p>generally, when possible I would always prefer an external link
    to an authority file for places out of scope which we are not going
    to describe or give details about. If there is already a record, no
    need to delete it or update it. Simply add the geonames ID.</p>
         <p>adding references to places not in our db: * for ancient place
    prefere pleiades, with namespace pleiades: * for places related to
    coptic literary tradition use PAThs paths:</p>

            <p>Filenames and IDs should correspond EXACTLY and as always they
      are case sensitive. The main xml:id of a record is directly into
      the <gi>TEI</gi> root element.</p>
            <p>

            <p>The titles of persons, such as ʾabbā, wayzaro, makʷannǝn etc.,
      should be encoded with
      <gi>roleName type="title"</gi> at
      the place in the texts where they occur. In order to be reasonably
      retrievable, <gi>roleName</gi> always has to
      be encoded within <gi>persName</gi>. The
      name of the person can be typed in the
      <gi>persName</gi>, or, if avoiding typing it
      is preferable, the <gi>persName</gi> element
      with the same ID can be repeated immediately after the first
      <gi>persName</gi> which contains
      <gi>roleName</gi>:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
It lists the books belonging to <persName ref="PRS10796Tasfo"><roleName type="title">ʾabbā</roleName></persName><persName ref="PRS10796Tasfo"/>

</egXML>
            <p>will both be visualized as: It lists the books belonging to
      ʾabbā Tasfo.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if only the title encoded should be visualized
      (without the name of the person it refers to), it should be marked
      up in the following way:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
he was also appointed as <persName ref="PRS5309hesanMo"><roleName type="title">qāla nǝguś</roleName></persName> of King <persName ref="PRS2334BaedaM">Baʾǝda Māryām I</persName>
</egXML>
            <p>The use of <gi>roleName</gi> has to be
      clearly separated from the use of @role. The first is used to mark
      up a concrete title mentioned in a text, the second specifies the
      role the person has in regard to the record in which it is
      mentioned. This applies for instance to scribes or owners of
      manuscripts.</p>
            <p>If possible, persNames should take a
      <att>role</att> where relevant in the description,
      and then don't need to be listed again in
      <gi>listPers</gi>:</p>
