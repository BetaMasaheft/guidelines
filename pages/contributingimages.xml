      <p>The best thing you can do to share images with the community of users is to publish them as IIIF. This is at least what we also do.
        If you do not know how to do that, you coudl share them in a long term repository like Zenodo, and let us know, please. If also this is not easy for you for some reason you can still
         send the organized image sets to us and we will store them along with the other images, eventually linking the image set to a TEI description.</p>
