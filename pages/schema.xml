            <head>Editing the ODD (i.e. the Schema)</head>
            <p>There is very good tutorial to <ref
                    target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml">edit ODD (One
                    Document Does it all)</ref> among the TEI resources.</p>
            <p>But to add rules it is safer to ask somebody who has done it, while in most cases you
                will be simply adding a value to an existing list.</p>
            <p>Please, try to discuss any schema update in a issue.</p>
            <p>After editing the ODD, use the Oxygen transformation for TEI ODD to RelaxNG which is
                already available in the software and will save a .rng file in a out directory
                relative to the place where your schema is stored.</p>
            <p>Before committing the edited schema, test it locally validating a file against that
                new version of the rng schema.</p>
            <p>Move then the new version in the main schema repository (not in the out subdirectory) and commit it. This will update the schema used by all the applications.</p>
            <p>If you are not sure of what you are doing please ask.</p>
