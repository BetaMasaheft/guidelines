   <text>
      <body xml:id="roles">
        <div type="level2">
<head>Mark up of the text</head>
<div type="level3">
<head>persons with a role</head>
<p>The titles of persons, such as ʾabbā, wayzaro, makʷannǝn etc.,
should be encoded with
<tag>roleName type="title"</tag> at
the place in the texts where they occur. In order to be reasonably
retrievable, <gi>roleName</gi> always has to
be encoded within <gi>persName</gi>. However, because <gi>roleName</gi> can also be used alone, you will have to be careful, the schema cannot help here.

So, when encoding names of persons, which might include the name of a role they have covered,
use of <gi>roleName</gi> inside <gi>persName</gi> to encode the role associated to that person in that text.
</p>
</div>
<div type="level3">
<head>an office or role as such</head>
<p>There are also names of offices, where no exact person is indicated (like in the <ref target="LIT4969EdictGala" type="bm">Edict of King Galāwdewos</ref>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <ab>ወለተሳየጦሂ፡ እምደቂቀ፡ ዐረብ፡ እንዘ፡ የአምር፡ ከመ፡ ውእቱ፡ ክርስቲያናዊ፡ ይንሥእዎ፡
    ኵሎ፡ ንዋዮ። ኵሉ፡ <roleName type="office">አዛዢ።</roleName>
    አው፡ <roleName type="office">ፈታሕት፡</roleName> አው፡ <roleName type="office">መኮንን፡</roleName> አው፡
    <roleName type="office">ስዩመ፡</roleName> ሀገረ፡ ዘኢይፈትሕ፡ በዘ፡ አዘዝነ፡ ቦቱ፡
    ይትቀተል፡ ዘእንበለ፡ ምሕረት፡ ወይትበርበር፡ ኵሉ፡ ንዋዩ፡ ወይኩን፡ ውጉዘ፡ በአፈ፡
    አብ፡ ወወልድ፡ ወመንፈስ፡ ቅዱስ፡ ወበአፈ፡ ኵሎሙ፡ አበው፡ ዘተወክፈቶሙ፡ ቤተ ክርስቲያን። </ab>
  </egXML>

In this case use <gi>roleName</gi> alone to encode the name of the office.</p>

<p>If looking at an unidentified officer named only via his role in a text, also use a roleName alone. The visualization should pull up a list of parallel marked up texts and might help you to identify the person and consequently mark it up.</p>

</div>
<div type="level3">
  <head><gi>roleName</gi> and <att>role</att></head>
  <p> The
name of the person can be typed in the
<gi>persName</gi>, or, if avoiding typing it
is preferable, the <gi>persName</gi> element
with the same ID can be repeated immediately after the first
<gi>persName</gi> which contains
<gi>roleName</gi>:</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
It lists the books belonging to <persName ref="PRS10796Tasfo"><roleName type="title">ʾabbā</roleName></persName><persName ref="PRS10796Tasfo"/>
</egXML>
  <p>and</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
It lists the books belonging to <persName ref="PRS10796Tasfo"><roleName type="title">ʾabbā</roleName> Tasfo</persName>
</egXML>
  <p>will both be visualized as: It lists the books belonging to
ʾabbā Tasfo.</p>
  <p>Therefore, if only the title encoded should be visualized
(without the name of the person it refers to), it should be marked
up in the following way:</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
he was also appointed as <persName ref="PRS5309hesanMo"><roleName type="title">qāla nǝguś</roleName></persName> of King <persName ref="PRS2334BaedaM">Baʾǝda Māryām I</persName>
</egXML>
  <p>The use of <gi>roleName</gi> has to be
clearly separated from the use of <att>role</att>. The first is used to mark
up a concrete title mentioned in a text, the second specifies the
role the person has in regard to the record in which it is
mentioned. This applies for instance to scribes or owners of
manuscripts.</p>
  <p>If possible, persNames should take a
<att>role</att> where relevant in the description,
and then don't need to be listed again in
<gi>listPers</gi>:</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<item xml:id="e1">
<locus target="#60v #143r #144r #152v #167v #171r #173r #189v #192r #234r #255r"/>
<desc>The names of the owner <persName role="owner" ref="PRS11297ZenaG"/> and his wife <persName ref="PRS11298SeyonM"/> are mentioned several times.</desc>
</item>
</egXML>
  <p>If there is no sensible place within the description, then the
information on the role can also be encoded in
<gi>listPers</gi> in
<gi>particDesc</gi>.</p>
  </div>
        </div>
      <div type="level2">
<head>Use in person records</head>
<p>Here you would encode known roles covered by a person, without further specification. The actual attestations of the person with that or other roles will be picked up in the visualization.</p>
<p>Please see the page about <ref target="persons">persons</ref> under the section "Roles".</p>
      </div>
