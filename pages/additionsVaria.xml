            <div type="level2">
                <head>Additions</head>
                <p>An "addition" is a neutral term to indicate that someting is "later
added" or secondary from the view point of the cataloguer: it should
never be used to mark a content, that presupposes another perspective.</p>
                <p>Additions (or <hi rendition="simple:italic">additiones</hi>)
                    are very often written in
                    a secondary hand, and they are later than the main text(s) of
                    the manuscript. They mark the so-called "secondary life" of
                    the manuscript as the latter is used as a repository of
                    documentary information, i.e. a true archive. These value are
                    provided for the <att>type</att> in the <gi>desc</gi>
                    element. </p>
                    <p>It is crucial that <gi>additions</gi> should be used only for
                        elements added later to the text! Therefore, they do not include
                        subscriptions or supplications written at the same time as the main texts.</p>
                    <p>When describing an addition, please provide if possible:
                    <list>
                        <item>language;</item>
                        <item>hand (by
                            a recent/old hand, by the same hand as that of the main text,
                            by the same hand as that of another addition, etc.); "in a
                            secondary hand" should be avoided: it is obvious;</item>
                        <item>ink (in
                            recent ink, hardly legible because of the faded ink, etc.).</item>
                        <item>readability (hardly readable, washed/scratched out etc.);</item>
                        <item>whether the addition is rhymed.</item>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p>If you cannot decide if the text is a main content or an addition,
                  follow the criteria identified by Andrist in the COMSt book (p. 512) to identify strata.
                  Additions would always be quaternary strata (independent content, not indepedent material,
                  autonomous writing project) whereas copied additions are primary strata.
                  In the case in which a manuscript has a donation note which is a "added written element"
                  thus preserving its writing project and the integrity of its content in comparison with the main text,
                  but without material independence, than it is an addition, and we encode it as such.
                  If instead the unit is part of a primary writing project,
                  the fact that it is copied from an addition does not change the fact that it is an msItem in a msPart or msDesc.</p>
                  <p>The example of the Liber Aksumae compilation, should be encoded as msItems. </p>
                <p>These additions are encoded in an
                    <gi>additions</gi> element in <gi>physDesc</gi>, which will contain a
                    <gi>list</gi> of additions. A general note on all
                        additions can be added before <gi>list</gi>
                        within a <gi>note</gi> element.</p>
                   <p>Each
                    <gi>item</gi> will have a structure as follows:
                </p>

                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <list>
                    <item xml:id="a1">
                        <locus target="#1r"/>
                        <desc type="OwnershipNote">Crude ownership note in pencil.</desc>

                    </item>
                    </list>
                </egXML>

                <p>
                    The <att>xml:id</att> of additions will use "a" and a
                    consecutive number. </p>
                <p>If the language of the addition is known but no excerpt is
                    copied, use an empty <gi>q</gi> as in the
                    following example from <ref target="BLAdd16187" type="bm">BLAdd16187</ref> .</p>
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <q xml:lang="am"/>
                </egXML>
                <p>You can specify the type of addition in the <gi>desc</gi> element,
                    using one of the values provided for the
                    <att>type</att>.</p>
                <p>If the addition is written in the margin or on a guard leaf, add to
                    <gi>item</gi> also a
                    <att>rend</att> with value <val>marginal</val> or
                    <val>guardLeaf</val>.</p>
                <p>If the type of document is known, then there should be a
                    value in the <att>type</att> of the element <gi>desc</gi>.
                    Additionally, if the content is actually identifiable with a Textual or Narrative Unit, this can be specified, adding <gi>title</gi> element with a <att>ref</att> in <gi>desc</gi>.
                  </p>
                <p>More examples are provided in the page about <ref target="documents">documents</ref>.
                  The following example, from <ref target="BLorient494" type="BM">London, British Library, BL Oriental 494</ref> shows
                  also how you can assert an alternative value for this identification.</p>

                  </item>
                </egXML>
                <p>As clarified also in the page about <ref target="documents">documents</ref>,
                although sometimes the value of <att>type</att> might be the same as the corresponding Narrative Unit, there is no requirement to put either or both, it is up to the encoder to decide what to do.</p>
                <p>Selecting a value from the list of defined once for <gi>desc</gi> is already a
                  grouping label option which can be assigned, eventually,
                  for example if starting from a catalogue information, without any knowledge of the text.</p>
                <p>If a work with its own work ID is added later to a
                    manuscript, it will be added as an addition specified with the
                    type "GuestText" having its work ID in the
                    description:</p>

                <p>The same you can do if there is <ref target="Documents">documentary text</ref>
                which you want to identify.
                  When creating the record a keyword should then be used to put
                  the text in its correct position as non-literary.
                  We have in the category of keywords for Subjects for example "Other" but also "Legal Document".
                  If a given textual unit is in fact according to the definition in the schema a
                  Donation Note or a letter, you can add that keyword to the work record.</p>
<p>If the text is a primary strata and we happen to have also manuscripts where this text is an addition,
  then you could add a <gi>relation</gi> (e.g. with  <val>saws:isCopyOf</val> for <att>name</att>) which connects the <gi>msItem</gi> with the addition in question.</p>
                <p>In additions as anywhere in the manuscript description, a <gi>handNote</gi> should be created for each identifiable hand, whether it can be described from available pictures of the manuscript
                    or whether the catalogue provides sufficient information for assigning certain additions to individual hands.
                If no such information is available, no <gi>handNote</gi> should be created, as it cannot always be excluded that the addition is written in the hand of the main text.</p>

                <p>Under  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Varia</hi> or <hi rendition="simple:italic">extra</hi>, we list the following phenomena, which simply concern the
                    copying process or are more trivial than
                    <hi rendition="simple:italic">additiones</hi>:
<list>
  <item>the title of
  the work written on the front board or cover, sometimes with
  blue or black paint or ink;</item>
  <item>the midpoint in the "Psalms of
  David" (in Ps. 77, after the word በደመና፡);</item>
  <item>the presence
  of stamps of the owning <ref target="institution">repository</ref>;</item>
  <item>part of the line is
  taken up or taken down (e.g., in the Psalters);</item>
    <item>glosses written in the margins;</item>
  <item>the so-called
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">tamallas</hi>-sign, in the shape
 of a cross (as +) or two perpendicular lines (as ┴ or├),
 indicating the place where the omissions (written in the upper
 or lower margin) belong;</item>
 <item>omitted letters, words,
lines or passages inserted interlineally, in the margins, at
the beginning/end of the line ;</item>
    <item>erasures;</item>
<item>corrections written over erasures, in the main hand or in a
    later recent hand;</item>
<item>erasures marked with thin black
    and red lines;</item>
<item>corrections immediately indicated by
the scribe through thin series of dashes above and below the
letters or the words;</item>
<item>spaces for rubricated names
    left unfilled;</item>
<item>unfilled spaces marked with thin
    black lines;</item>
<item>cues for the rubricator written in the
    margin or in the interocolumn (e.g., small digits);</item>
<item>erased names or names secondarily written over erased names
    (typically in the supplication formulas);</item>
<item>the
scribe reduced the size of his handwriting to accommodate the
end of the line;</item>
<item>the scribe used compressed script
("compressed" means two lines in a space originally
meant for one single line), often to accommodate lines written
over erasure;</item>
<item>monthly or daily readings are usually
indicated by writing the names of the months and weekdays in
the upper margin of the folio, sometimes within frames;</item>
<item>pen
trials, notes crudely written in pencil or pen;</item>
<item>scribbles and doodles.</item>
  </list></p>

                    <p>Please not that these phenomena should only be encoded under Varia if the text in which they occur is not transcribed. I.e. if space for
                    rubrications in left unfilled in incipits, and these incipits are transcribed in the manuscript description, the unfilled spaces should be encoded properly there and the
                    information does not need to be repeated under Varia.</p>
