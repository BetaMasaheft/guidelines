                <p>Additions (or <hi rendition="simple:italic">additiones</hi>)
                    are very often written in
                    a secondary hand, and they are later than the main text(s) of
                    the manuscript. They mark the so-called "secondary life" of
                    the manuscript as the latter is used as a repository of
                    documentary information, i.e. a true archive. These value are
                    provided for the <att>type</att> in the <gi>desc</gi>
                    element. </p>
                    <p>It is crucial that <gi>additions</gi> should be used only for
                        elements added later to the text! Therefore, they do not include subscriptions or supplications written at the same time as the main texts.</p>
                    <p>When describing an addition, please provide if possible:
                    <list>
                        <item>language;</item>

                            a recent/old hand, by the same hand as that of the main text,
                            by the same hand as that of another addition, etc.); "in a
                            secondary hand" should be avoided: it is obvious;</item>

                            recent ink, hardly legible because of the faded ink, etc.).</item>

                <p>These additions are encoded in an 
                    <gi>additions</gi> element in <gi>physDesc</gi>, which will contain a
                    <gi>list</gi> of additions. A general note on all
                        additions can be added before <gi>list</gi>
                        within a <gi>note</gi> element.</p>
                   <p>Each
                    <gi>item</gi> will have a structure as follows:

                <p>If the language of the addition is known but no excerpt is

                <p>You can specify the type of addition in the <gi>desc</gi> element,

                    <att>type</att>.</p>
                <p>If the addition is written in the margin or on a guard leaf, add to

                <p>If the type of document is known, then there should be a

  <item>the title of

  <item>the midpoint in the "Psalms of
  David" (in Ps. 77, after the word በደመና፡);</item>
  <item>the presence
  of stamps of the owning <ref target="institution">repository</ref>;</item>
  <item>part of the line is
  taken up or taken down (e.g., in the Psalters);</item>
    <item>glosses written in the margins;</item>
  <item>the so-called
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">tamallas</hi>-sign, in the shape
 of a cross (as +) or two perpendicular lines (as ┴ or├),
 indicating the place where the omissions (written in the upper
 or lower margin) belong;</item>
 <item>omitted letters, words,
lines or passages inserted interlineally, in the margins, at
the beginning/end of the line ;</item>
    <item>erasures;</item>
<item>corrections written over erasures, in the main hand or in a
    later recent hand;</item>
<item>erasures marked with thin black
    and red lines;</item>
<item>corrections immediately indicated by
the scribe through thin series of dashes above and below the
letters or the words;</item>
<item>spaces for rubricated names
    left unfilled;</item>
<item>unfilled spaces marked with thin
    black lines;</item>
<item>cues for the rubricator written in the
    margin or in the interocolumn (e.g., small digits);</item>
<item>erased names or names secondarily written over erased names
    (typically in the supplication formulas);</item>
<item>the
scribe reduced the size of his handwriting to accommodate the
end of the line;</item>
<item>the scribe used compressed script
("compressed" means two lines in a space originally
meant for one single line), often to accommodate lines written
over erasure;</item>
<item>monthly or daily readings are usually
indicated by writing the names of the months and weekdays in
the upper margin of the folio, sometimes within frames;</item>
<item>pen
trials, notes crudely written in pencil or pen;</item>
<item>scribbles and doodles.</item>

                    <p>Please not that these phenomena should only be encoded under Varia if the text in which they occur is not transcribed. I.e. if space for
                    rubrications in left unfilled in incipits, and these incipits are transcribed in the manuscript description, the unfilled spaces should be encoded properly there and the
                    information does not need to be repeated under Varia.</p>
