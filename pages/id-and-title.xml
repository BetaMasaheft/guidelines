         <p>The manuscript ID should be composed of: - The abbreviation of
    the institution holding the manuscript, as it is contained in the
    insitution ID, written in capitals - The abbreviation of the
    collection to which the manuscript belongs - a numeral: BAVet1 The
    collection and the numeral should be given as they are in the
    current/most commonly used official shelfmark of the manuscript.</p>
         <p>If the manuscript has not yet been catalogued and/or has no shelf
    mark, an ID has to created individually, following as much as
    possible the usual process_ - The abbreviation of the institution
    holding the manuscript, as it is contained in the institution ID,
    written in capitals - If no more information is available, the ID
    can be created with a work contained in the manuscript and a
    numeral, such as: TMChronicle1</p>

         <p>The title should be intended as a generic title for this
    manuscript record, which might refer to contents or identifiers. The
    title should be made of all the normalized titles of the works
    contained in the manuscript. If there are many different works which
    would make the title too long, it is possible to create a more
    generic title where this makes sense.</p>
